# PowerBI-Sales-Data-Analysis

This project aims to provide comprehensive insights into sales data using Power BI. By visualizing various metrics and dimensions, we can uncover patterns, correlations, and insights to drive sales strategies and decisions.

Data Source: 
The primary data source for this project is an Excel file containing fields such as Product, Region, Salesperson, Quantity, Total Sales, Month, and Year.

Steps for Data Preparation and Cleaning:

1. Load Data: Import the Excel file into Power BI.
2. Data Transformation: Use Power BI's Query Editor for data cleaning and transformation:
3. Split the date into separate Day, Month, and Year columns.
4. Validate Total Sales values.
5. Create a Full Date column for time series analysis.

Visualizations and Insights:

1. Total Sales by Product:

Visualization Type: Stacked Bar Chart
Why: Helps in understanding which products are top performers and which are lagging.

2. Sales Distribution by Region:

Visualization Type: Pie Chart or Donut Chart
Why: Provides a percentage breakdown of sales by region, allowing for a quick understanding of regional performance.

3. Monthly Sales Trends:

Visualization Type: Line Chart
Why: Observe monthly fluctuations in sales and identify potential seasonal trends.

4. Sales Performance of Salespeople:

Visualization Type: Column Chart
Why: Understand the performance of individual salespeople, recognizing top performers and those who might need support.

5. Month-over-Month Growth Rate:

Visualization Type: Line Chart
Why: The Month-over-Month (MoM) growth rate shows the percentage change in sales from one month to the next. It's crucial for tracking sales momentum, identifying positive or negative trends, and making timely business decisions. A consistent upward trend indicates strong sales performance, whereas frequent downward trends may signal issues that need addressing.

6. Sales Concentration (Pareto Analysis):

Visualization Type: Line and Clustered Column Chart
Why: The Pareto principle (80/20 rule) helps identify a small number of products or categories that contribute to a large portion of the results.

7. Correlation Analysis:

Visualization Type: Scatter Plot
Why: A scatter plot is ideal for correlation analysis as it plots individual data points, allowing visual identification of patterns or correlations between two numeric variables.
